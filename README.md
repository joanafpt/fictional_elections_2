This is the first version of the website https://joanafpt.github.io/fictional/#/. It was developed with history (https://www.npmjs.com/package/history), which is not suitable for githubpages ( https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1765  ).

In order to enable the deployment in git hub pages, the other online version was slighlty changed from this one, and uses HashRouter - and do not use History.
